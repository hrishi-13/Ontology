# CS6852 Assignment 4: Inference using OWL

# Folder contents:
- moviesOntology.owl : owl file from assignment 3
- moviesCatalog.xml : xml file from assignment 1
- CS22M047_Assignment4.py
- CS22M047_infered.txt

# Executing the file:
- Open the CS22M047_Assignment4.py file on vscode
- Make sure you open the file from the folder containing the .xml files

# To check the consistency, open the moviesOntology.owl in "protege":
- Start the reasoner (Go to Reasoner, then click on Start Reasoner)
- Debug the ontology (Go to Tools, then Debug Ontology)
- On doing the above steps, we can see that the final ontology is coherent and consistent.

# Challenges:
- Extracting data from this complicated xml file was challenging. Feeding the data back into owl file was also challenging.
